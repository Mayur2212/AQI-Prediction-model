# AQI-Prediction-model
This project predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning. It involves data preprocessing, handling missing values, feature selection, and training a `RandomForestRegressor` model. The model is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score.
